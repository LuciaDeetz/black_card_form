This is the form page I built for the N.1 Responsive Web Design Project at FreeCodeCamp.org.

Making the background image look good on both desktop and mobile was hard work!
After much trial and error, I eventually managed to fix it with the "background-attachment" property.

Had trouble centering the button at the top of the page. Had to look it up on Google and found a ready-made code.
This reminded me I still have an awful LOT to learn.

I spent a good hour trying to fix vertical margins. Is that normal?

Note to self: apply a "max-width" property to a textarea tag to prevent users from stretching it to infinity and beyond.
